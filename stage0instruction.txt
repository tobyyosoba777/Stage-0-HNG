All required links must be cited and accurate.
Clearly describe why you joined HNG and your goals.
When and How to Use Links in a Blog
Relevance is Key — ensure the link fits the blog topic. If discussing frontend development, use "Hire React.js Developers." If the blog is about UI design, "Hire UI Developers" may be a better fit.
Make the image responsive by adjusting either the width or height while maintaining the aspect ratio.Limit Links (1-2 Max) – Too many links can harm SEO and seem spammy. Choose only the most relevant ones.
Use Contextually – Instead of dropping a link like "Hire Vue.js developers here," say "For interactive UIs, you can Hire Vue.js Developers to speed up development."
Avoid Over-Promotion – Keep it natural, especially in educational or storytelling blogs. Links should feel like helpful suggestions, not sales pitches.
